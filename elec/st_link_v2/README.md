# ST-LINK/V2 Schematic

Reusable schematic of a ST-LINK/V2 for projects with STM8/STM32 microcontrollers.
It can be add as a separate sheet in a KiCad project.

## ST-LINK/V2 purpose
The ST-LINK/V2 is an in-circuit debugger and programmer for the STM8 and STM32 microcontroller families. The single wire interface module (SWIM) and JTAG/serial wire debugging (SWD) interfaces are used to communicate with any STM8 or STM32 microcontroller located on an application board.
